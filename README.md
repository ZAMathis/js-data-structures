# Hello
This is repo was made in order for me to understand and write out different data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Everything is technically usable (maybe, nothing is tested, I just wanted to write things out to better understand them. there very well could be bugs everywhere) but that was not the point.

I'd like to go back and comment more things in so it could be readable to others. Also there's some things that could be rewritten to be a lot more efficient. This was just practice though in the end.
